# Results

`CorrelationFunctions.jl` is tested on overlapping disks and balls of constant
radius $R$ with centers generated by Poisson process with parameter $\lambda$
(see section 5.1 of Random Heterogeneous Materials). An example of a
two-dimensional two-phase system generated in this way is on the picture ($R =
25$ and $\lambda = 5 \cdot 10^{-4}$):

Plots of all correlation functions calculated by `CorrelationFunctions.jl` for
overlapping disks along with their theoretical values are given below. There
are also plots of relative errors calculated as

$\text{err}(x) = \mid \frac{\text{calculation}(x) -
\text{theory}(x)}{\text{theory}(x)} \mid$

## Methodology

All functions in this section with exception of pore size and chord length
functions are calculated on 15 random datasets generated with parameters $R =
25$ and $\lambda = 5 \cdot 10^{-4}$. Each dataset is an image with dimensions
`4000x4000` pixels. The final result is an average of results on those 15
datasets. When function fastly decreases to zero a plot of a natural logarithm
of that function is provided.

Pore size and chord length functions are calculated on one `4000x4000`
dataset with the same parameters as above. A theoretical value is computed by
averaging a theoretical function across each bin of a histogram returned by
`pore_size` or `chord_length` function. Because both pore size and cord length
functions decrease to zero with increase of their arguments, the relative errors
are calculated for the corresponding cummulative distribution functions.
