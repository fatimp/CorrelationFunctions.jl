    chord_length(array, phase[; directions,] nbins = 10)

Calculate chord length correlation function for one-, two- or
three-dimensional multiphase system.

Cord length function `p(x)` equals to probability of finding a chord
whose length is in the range `[x, x+Î´x]` and which lies entirely in the
phase `phase`. A chord is a line segment which touches the boundary of
a same-phase cluster with its ends.

This implementation bins chord lengths into `nbins` bins and returns
normalized histogram on collected data and the mean chord length in a
tuple.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> chord_length([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], 0)
(StatsBase.Histogram{Float64,1,Tuple{StepRangeLen{Float64,Base.TwicePrecision{Float64},Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}}}}
edges:
  4.0:1.0:5.0
weights: [1.0]
closed: left
isdensity: false, 4.0)
```
