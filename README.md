[![CI](https://github.com/shamazmazum/CorrelationFunctions.jl/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shamazmazum/CorrelationFunctions.jl/actions/workflows/test.yml)

`CorrelationFunctions.jl` is a library of correlation functions as described in
Salvatore Torquato's book "Random Heterogeneous Materials".

To build a documentation do the following.

1. From Julia REPL: `import Pkg; Pkg.add("Documenter")`
2. From shell, this directory being the working directory: `cd docs && julia make.jl`

Also the documentation for the most recent release is available on
[GitHub Pages](https://shamazmazum.github.io/CorrelationFunctions.jl/v0.2.0/).
